## ü§î Expo CLI Usage

This project utilizes Expo CLI instead of React Native CLI for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency and Convenience:** Expo CLI offers a streamlined development experience with its pre-configured tools and built-in components. This allows for faster development cycles and reduces the overhead of configuring native modules.

2. **Small-Scale Application:** As our project is relatively small in scope, Expo CLI provides sufficient functionality without the need for extensive customization or native module integrations. This simplifies the development process and accelerates time-to-market.

3. **Additional Benefits:** In addition to rapid development, Expo CLI provides other advantages tailored to our specific use case, such as simplified build and deployment processes, access to Expo's extensive library of plugins and services, and seamless integration with Expo's development tools.
